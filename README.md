# 1. Introduction to Programming:

    Familiarize yourself with basic programming concepts like variables, data types, control structures (if-else, loops), and functions.

# 2. Basics of C++:

    Get acquainted with C++ syntax, input/output operations, and fundamental programming constructs.

# 3. Functions and Scope:

    Learn about function declaration, definition, and calling.
    Understand function scope, local and global variables.

# 4. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:

    Understand the core OOP concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    Grasp the concept of data abstraction and separation of interface from implementation.

# 5. Classes and Objects:

    Study how to create classes and objects in C++.
    Explore member variables, member functions, constructors, and destructors.

# 6. Encapsulation:

    Learn about access specifiers (public, private, protected) and how they control class member visibility.
    Understand the concept of information hiding and encapsulation.

# 7. Constructors and Destructors:

    Explore different types of constructors (default, parameterized, copy).
    Understand the purpose of destructors and their role in resource management.

# 8. Inheritance:

    Learn about creating a hierarchy of classes using inheritance.
    Understand base and derived classes, and how to access base class members from derived classes.

# 9. Polymorphism:

    Study runtime polymorphism using virtual functions and the concept of dynamic binding.
    Understand the use of the virtual keyword and the override specifier.

# 10. Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

    Learn about abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
    Understand how to create interfaces in C++.

# 11. Operator Overloading:

    Explore how to overload operators to work with user-defined types.
    Learn about operator overloading syntax and best practices.

# 12. Templates:

    Understand how to create generic classes and functions using templates.
    Learn about function templates and class templates.

# 13. Standard Template Library (STL):

    Familiarize yourself with the STL containers (vector, list, map, etc.) and algorithms.
    Learn how to use iterators to traverse containers.

# 14. Smart Pointers:

    Study smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr) for better memory management.

# 15. Exception Handling:

    Learn about handling exceptions using try-catch blocks.
    Understand the concept of exception propagation and creating custom exceptions.

# 16. Design Patterns (Optional, but recommended):

    Study common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
    Understand their application in designing robust and maintainable systems.

# 17. Projects and Practice:

    Apply what you've learned by working on small to medium-sized projects.
    Practice coding, debugging, and problem-solving regularly.
